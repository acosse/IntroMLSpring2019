Set \"sgd\" as your solver. The loss is what is optimized by the SGD algorithm when you train your network. As we deal with binary variables, \"categorical_crossentropy\" is a good idea. Finally, through the iterations, we might want to monitor the improvement of the model with respect to some criterion. You can specify such a criterion through the \"metrics\" argument of your call to compile. The \"metrics\" argument enables you to define an additional function to monitor through the iterations. We could for example display the the average number of misclassified images. This is can be done with metrics=['accuracy']\n",
